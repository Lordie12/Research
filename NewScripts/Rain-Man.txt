He wants Charlie' s attention, but he can 't get it as ...
CHARLIE
Yeah, well, it's been five and a half weeks!	Weeks!

Daryl has problems of his own.	And growing.
(CONTINUED)

DARYL
Well, sir, I hardly think that's necessary ...

A woman enters.	Dressed attractively for the road , carrying her overnighter.	She is quite beautiful.	This is SUSAN, Charlie's girl friend.	A sweetness about her, a refinement that seems out of place here.
CHARLIE
Yeah, loan? thou,
so what do I tell my swing I'm into him two hundred okay?	Thou!	Three zeros.

Susan catches his eye. He holds up his hand.
Shows her watch.	They're late. Just a sec.	Turns away ...

CHARLIE
He could have taken the cars eleven  days ago!	They're collateral for chrissake!		I'm holding him off
with a whip and a chair!
The PHONE RINGS now on the empty desk.	Charlie' s eyes go to Susan, asking her to get it.	She steps to his desk.
Pulls off an earring as she brings the receiver to her
ear.

CHARLIE
Tell him ... you don't understand. I signed the check on Tuesday.
You watched me sign it with all the others.	And personally gave it to the mail girl.

She's shaking her head.	He's got to be kidding.	But he's not.	He strokes her hair.	There's heat in the touch.

CHARLIE
Please.	I need this.

SUSAN
Sir, I don 't understand this.	Mr. Babbitt signed the check on Tuesday.	I watched him sign it with all the others.	And I personally gave them to the mail girl.

Just a second.	My other line.
Back on hold.	Her eyes go to Charlie.
SUSAN
Five-thirty.	No dicking around.
Charlie is pacing now.	We see no desperation .	Only an animal in his natural habitat ...

DARYL
Yessir, well as soon as Mr. Babbitt gets back from his meeting ...
Charlie goes to help ...


Charlie ...
SUSAN (O.S.)

He turns.	A little quickly this time.
SUSAN
Watch his lips.	Five- thirty.
His deep breath.	Fighting back the urge to snap at her.

CHARLIE
I'm on a plane to Atlanta.	You'll have a replacement check on my desk to sign first thing Monday.
It's the best you can do ... please, please, please don't kill you with Mr. Babbitt on this ... you really need the job ...
(a little sharp)
Okay?
The tone stung her a little, but he's already turned back to Daryl, as ...

DARYL
Well, I wouldn 't do that , sir, until you talked with Mr. Babbitt personally .•.

Uh, a number for him ...?
Charlie shakes his head sharply.	No way.

You wanna put your brain in gear,
baby?	Just one time?
That really hurts.	But she keeps it together.
SUSAN
You have to call him when you land.
DARYL (O.S.)
Charlie ...
He ignores Daryl.	Stays on her.
CHARLIE
I'm connecting to Barbados.
Arrive at one A.M.	Would he like to leave his home number?

Hear Daryl's BANGING again.
DARYL (O.S.)
Charlie ...

Charlie whirls and in a single motion of his arm, clears Daryl's desk.	Every goddam thing goes flying.	CRASHING. Daryl might be peeing.	Charlie's voice is exaggerated calm ...

CHARLIE
You have a problem?
Daryl swallows hard.

DARYL
Mr. Bateman wants to back out on his car. And take Mr. Webb with him.
(beat)
They, uh ... want their down payments back.
Charlie closes his eyes.
DARYL
They found two cars at Valley Motors.	And they want to go that way.

SUSAN (O.S.)
Charlie, please .•.

He turns back to her.	Slowly.

SUSAN
He wants to know where the cars are.
Charlie nods.	His ace in the hole.
CHARLIE
Tell him the truth.	You don't know.
And back to Daryl ...

CHARLIE
Tell him that was me on your other line.	I just settled out with
E.P.A.	And ...

... I'm knocking five grand off both their deals.	Because I appreciate their patience.

Daryl punches up his call, and Charlie goes back to Susan.	She's just hanging up.	Sends him a weak smi1e...

SUSAN
The air comes out of him.	And the tension with it.	His hands go to her shoulders.		He seems grateful, and that reaches her.	Stares at her eyes.	Kisses her mouth with surprising tenderness.

CHARLIE
So.	Ready for Palm Springs?
SUSAN
We're still going?
He nods.	No problem.

CHARLIE
This is all a ... real minor glitch.

He glances over.	Her eyes are right there.	She smiles a lovely smile.

SUSAN

_7	EXT. CHICAGO SUBURB - CEMETERY - DAY	7

High on a graceful cemetery hill, a funeral service is about to commence.	Gathered near the gravesite are a handful of well-to- do mourners.	All elderly , all in somber black.	A memory wreath reads simply:	"SANFORD BABBITT."	A minister stands silently , his hands folded before him.	Glances at his watch, as we hear the sound of a CAR APPROACHING.	Look up to see ...

••• A Lincoln town car rumbling up the hill.	It stops well down the road.

With Charlie now, as he climbs out.	Susan remains seated , watching him.	Charlie seems transformed.	A young executive, carefully smoothing the wrinkles from his dark pin-striped suit.	But it's more than the clothes.	He stands erect.	Squaring his shoulders, as he stares up
the hill.	The flash is gone.	Something in his bearing now faintly patrician.

SUSAN
I think you're expected.
We look up the hill . All eyes are staring back.

EXT. CEMETERY - LATER	8
(		... Mourners at the grave, singing a soft hymn.	Charlie and Susan stand slightly to one side.	Silent, but respectful.

As the singing continues, the eyes of the various mourners flick over to Charlie then look away as if their glimpse was illicit.	Except for the gray -haired gentleman next
to the minister.	This is MOONEY, the lawyer.	His eyes stay firmly on Charlie.	Appraising.	Non- committal.

EXT. CEMETERY - LATER	9
... The mourners are gone.	Way down at the bottom of the hill, Susan stands alone by the car.

HER POV - UP HILL

To see ... Charlie approach Mooney.		They shake hands.	 A little stiffly.	Talk MOS.	Then Mooney pulls out a key chain.	Takes a key from the ring.	Hands it now to Charlie, who puts it in his breast pocket.

EXT. CHARLIE'S FATHER'S HOUSE - DAY	10
Lake Forest estate.	Modest for a mansion, but impressive nonetheless.	Charlie's getting the suitcases from the car.	Sees Susan staring at the place.

CHARLIE
It's called a house.	People live in them.

SUSAN
I had no idea you ... came from all this.

His small smile.

Thanks.

CHARLIE

He's carrying the suitcases up the walk.	She's following slowly.	Still drinking it in.

SUSAN
I didn 't mean it like that.	I meant ... minor glitches and all.

He sees something.	Sets the suitcases down.

He's standing by the other car now.	A smoothly-polished Buick convertible.	1962.	Robin 's-egg blue and cherried out from top to bottom.	Charlie runs the back of his knuckle across the finish.
SUSAN
Some car.

CHARLIE
I know this car all my life.	Only drove it one time.

Something in the way he said that.	Peculiar.	She's standing at a row of rose bushes in the center of a green circle.

SUSAN
Somebody should be watering these.

Charlie looks over.	Not at her.	At the flowers.
CHARLIE
Don 't worry about it.
INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY	11
Charlie and Susan enter the musty, high-ceilinged room. Heavy Baroque furniture in carved mahogany.	Antiques. Muted oils in gilt frames.	The room is vast, ponderous. And very quiet.

Charlie stands.	Eyes moving over all of it.	Susan is watching him.	Finally ...

Susan is on the floor in front of an open closet. She has some old cartons out. Looking through the remains of Charlie's childhood. He looks over at her now.
Watches her dispassionately.  But when she looks up ...
... he sends her an intimate smile.	She likes that. Brushes her hair back.

SUSAN
Well, that's a funny look.
CHARLIE
For a crazy lady ... you have nice ears.

SUSAN
I'm not crazy.	You were his only child.	You came along when he was, what ... forty-five or something.
Probably thought he was never going to have a son...

Charlie keeps grinning.	Goes to her now.
SUSAN
So why did he hate you?
CHARLIE
Pink ears.	And they're a little pointy.	Right ... there.

As he touches her, her fingers go to his hand.	Close around it.	The look holds for a beat before he breaks the spell•..

CHARLIE

INT. CHARLIE'S ROOM - NIGHT	13
Susan in Charlie' s bed.	In her lap, a photo album. Charlie at four years old.	Two-wheeler already.	Little wobbly.	Then at seven. Alone on the shore.	Scrawny chest, baggy trunks.	Turn the page.	Eleven now.	Pony League trophy.	Big smile.	Standing with his dad.
INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT	14
Seated at the dining room table are Charlie and Mooney. The lawyer has a stack of papers spread before him.	We sense Charlie's motor running.	But he's keeping it under wraps.
MOONEY
... Now we'll get to the actual reading of the will in a moment , but first I have this statement which your father requested that I read to you.	Do you have any objections?
Why should I?
CHARLIE
Mooney stares at him.	Then opens the letter.
MOONEY
'To my son, Charles Babbitt.	Dear Charles:	Today I turned seventy.
Iam an old man, but not too old to remember vividly the day we
brought you home from the hospital, your late mother and I.	You were the perfect child, so full of life
... and promise.	And  Iremember too the day you left home, so full of bitterness and grandiose ideas. So full of yourself ...'
Mooney looks up to judge the reaction.	But Charlie reveals nothing.

MOONEY
'I can understand and forgive your rejection of the life Ioffered you.	College ... and the other advantages so eagerly accepted by your peers ...'
Charlie smiles blandly.

CHARLIE
He wrote it.	I hear his voice.

Or a hotel.	Continuing toward it , they approach a man, painting at an easel near the side of the road.	Charlie slows to a stop.	The man has his BACK TO us, shielding his painting from our view.

And as the man turns TO us, Susan's breath catches.	He has been fingerpainting.	His hands smeared with brightly-colored paints.		On his face, a small vacant smile.	Eyes that are childlike and far away.	It is a sweet look, actually.	Chilling only in its incongruity. Charlie stares for a frozen beat.	And drives on.

Charlie nods and smiles.	They'll be fine.	The Woman leaves.	And the smile fades.	The motor begins to run again. Charlie wanders to a doorway.	Looks down a corridor.

SUSAN
Charlie, I don't think we should poke around here.


Then don't.
CHARLIE

And he heads down the hallway.	The look is more sterile now, more like a hospital.	In a beat, Susan appears, hurrying to catch up.	She takes his arm.	A handsome young couple, they receive the benign smile of an attendant helping a large patient shuffle down the hall.

a toothpick.	Methodical.	One square at a time.

He settles onto the edge of their bed.	Puts the Fritos down on the writhing mass of covers.	And there he sits. Munching.	Watching.	Reaching for more chips, though it isn't easy, since the bag is jumping around pretty good. As the SOUNDS OF LOVE get really urgent , Raymond reaches without looking and touches ...

She stands close to him.	Holds up her arms in a formal dancing position.	He just stares at her.	And she smiles.
Waits.	Slowly now, his hands go to her arms ... bring them around his neck.	Just like Iris.

RAYMOND
You know how I like to dance? Sometimes.


Tell me.
SUSAN

RAYMOND
Barely even move.	And close my eyes.	And pretend ... we're
all alone.
She just nods.	Very straight.
SUSAN
Okay.	Let's pretend we're alone.

ASTAIRE (V.O.)
'We may never, never, meet again on that bumpy road to love ...'

Carefully nestling closer to him.	Fitting her body to his ...

ASTAIRE (V.O.)
'Still I'll always, always, keep the memory of ...'
Turning gracefully, easily in the tiny space ...
ASTAIRE (V.O.)
'The way you hold your knife. The way we danced 'til three. The way you changed my life ...
No, no , they can't take that away from me, no ...'

RAYMOND
Charlie Babbitt said.	If she was nice to me.	To give her ... a little kiss.
Oh.	Susan nods.	And comes closer.
SUSAN
Show me how ...
He purses his mouth like a child.	Makes her smile.	Her fingertips go to his lips now ...

SUSAN
Open your mouth. And kiss like ... you're eating something very soft. That tastes very good.

And then she shows him.	His mouth comes open.	She kisses each of his lips.		And tenderly draws his" mouth into hers.	Lingering ... and as lovely as she can make it.	And when she pulls back...
SUSAN
How did it taste?
RAYMOND
It tasted wet.
Her slow smile ...

SUSAN

And from his pocket, Raymond pulls out ... the two hundred dollars.	He holds it out to her.	And on her bemused expression ...

Real to the bone.	And as their eyes hold , her smile becomes the one he wanted.	Shy.	Vulnerable.	She turns away now;	Into the cab.	And gone.	And as they watch after her, Charlie tells his brother ...

This is a temporary restraining order.	Forbidding you ... under criminal penalties ... from removing Raymond.	Until the hearing is concluded.
Lays it on the table ...

LENZ
You see, Charlie, when the hearing is over ... Raymond will be committed into Lynwood.	For the first time in his life.	And he
has you to thank for that.
Charlie is just staring at the paper.	Finally ...
CHARLIE
That's ... up to the judge, isn't it?

LENZ
The judge will listen to the psychiatric investigator.	His name is Dr. Marston .	You'll meet him tomorrow morning.
Charlie still staring.	Trying to suck it up ...
CHARLIE
Great.	Maybe this guy has an open mind.

LENZ
I gave him boxes of files on Raymond.	Boxes.	This isn't a close call, son.	It's a
formality.	Your brother is a very disabled individual.	Haven 't

to get swept away by enthusiasm , I know.	A change of scenery ... new adventures ... and they can seem to

Sips his coffee slowly.	Can Charlie really hear this?

They plateau.	And then regress. A lifetime of illness isn't cured by a vacation, Charlie.	Dr.
Marston knows that.

But Charlie meets his eyes.	Head on.


Then again. it's over.

Sunlit courtyard.	Under a tree sits a woman of fifty. She is diligently coloring in a coloring book, while her parents quietly watch.	They are in their sevent':ies, and seem content just to sit and look at her.

PAN TO a bench along the wall.	A thirty-year- old man is sorting through a plastic baggie full of jelly beans.
Next to him sits his mother, reading a tabloid as she calmly threads her needlepoint, oblivious to her son's search.	He picks one out, looks at it closely.	Shoves it deep into his shirt pocket.

PAN once more TO Raymond.	Pacing.	Three steps this way. Three steps back.	In a stew.	Watching him, Charlie looks like an imitation of Raymond's tennis match observer.
Finally ...

Your brother's condition is lifelong. And meticulously documented.
Charlie nods.	Fine.

CHARLIE
C'mon, Ray, these guys are wasting our time. Let's go hit some baseballs.
(to Lenz)
See you fellas in court.
LENZ
Hold on, son.
That was not Charlie's favorite word.	It shows.
LENZ
This man is trying to understand something. your enemy here.
help you No one's
r	Yeah, that's

CHARLIE
right.	Nobody

wants
to lock me away.	For the rest of my life.
It's all coming back to him now.	The evangelica l rhythm
to his words ...

CHARLIE
But if they were.	There's only one person in this room, in this  world , who'd stand by me.	That man there!
--n;eat)
You're gonna take him away from me, you're in a knife fight!

LENZ
Stop selling, Charlie.
As cool as Charlie is hot.	Each man with his best weapon.

LENZ
Y'know, your father, for all his faults, didn 't let his ego get in the way of the truth.	About
your brother.

CHARLIE
Ego, huh?	Look in a mirror, pal. Ray came further with me in five days than he did with you in twenty goddam years!
(beat )
And you can't handle it.	And that's the truth!

In the silence, Lenz does not look angry.	Only sad.	He and Marston share a glance.	And then Marston turns to Raymond.	Raymond stops doing tennis match.		Hartson smiles.

MARSTON
Boy, this must have been some trip.	With your brother.	What happened ...?
Raymond thinks.	And then...

RAYMOND
I saw Daddy's ground.	And the cars tried to hit me.	And I played cards.	And I struck out Charlie Babbitt.		And I watched him fight Roger and Billy.	And I went to jail.		And I drove the car.	And ...

MARSTON
Whoa, whoa there ... I'm getting dizzy from your trip ...

He's pantomiming a headache. Like a children's clown. Raymond likes that. He likes this guy. Marston turns the smile to Charlie. And his voice lowers a notch ...

MARSTON
He drove ... a car?
RAYMOND
Fast!	And I waved ...
Raymond happily demonstrates the one-finger wave.	To Charlie' s dismay, this time Raymond gets it right.

MARSTON
Sounds like fun.	What else ...?

RAYMOND
(	And I met a whore, and ...

Marston holds up his hand.	Traffic cop.	Raymond snaps his mouth shut.	Marston grinning at him ...

MARSTON
Tell me about that one ...
RAYMOND
That one is Iris.	She's pretty.
Lenz is watching Charlie.	And Charlie looks real uneasy.
LENZ
Where did you meet Iris, Raymond?
RAYMOND
Where you drink the drinks.
128


In a bar.
LENZ

And Raymond nods.	He remembers the word.

MARSTON
How did you know ... she was a whore, Raymond?

RAYMOND
Charlie Babbitt said.	He said a whore is nice to men for money. He said money makes people nice. He gave me money to give her ...
SUSAN
But nothing happened!
And everybody turns.	All eyes on her now.
SUSAN
She was just going to dance with him.	It was innocent ... and sweet and ... Charlie was right to do it.

Her cheeks are coloring slightly.	She does not look at Charlie.	But he's sure looking at her.

LENZ
Do you know what Raymond would do
... if a pretty girl put her arms around him?

SUSAN
(	He'd dance with her.
And Lenz smiles.	Not condescending.	But amused emough to bring ...

SUSAN
He danced with me.	Real dancing. Holding each other.
A show stopper.	Charlie is more astonished than Lenz.
RAYMOND
Not like Charlie Babbitt! !

And the heads turn back to Ray.	The tennis- match image is building.

MARSTON
What does that mean, Raymond?
Raymond' s hands begin to twist together.	Just a little.
RAYMOND
Charlie Babbitt ... held me bad. He kept holding me and ... c'mon,
brothers do this stuff, and ... it's not fgggy, and ...
(more agitated)
serious injury ... serious injury , and I'd be ... I'd be
number one serious injury in... in 1988, and ...
... Turns now.	Straight to Charlie.

Silence.
RAYMOND
... And ... we're not ... we're not brothers.

CHARLIE
I thought ... I was forgiven.
RAYMOND
Sometimes.
Charlie nods.	Sometimes.	Turns to Lenz...
CHARLIE
I did it wrong.	I tried to make him hug me.	I thought I... was the one who could ... break through
make him ... (beat)
hug his brother ... kiss a

RAYMOND
I kissed a girl!
And the heads swivel once more. All except hers.
CHARLIE
You ... kissed ... Iris ...?
128

But Raymond's finger stabs out , identifying the "woman in question ."	And the heads swivel back.	She wants to
crawl in the deepest hole.	The eyes she turns to are Charlie' s ...

SUSAN
... In the elevator.	After we danced.


It was lifil:_!
RAYMOND

The heads go back again .	Particularly hers.	Raymond seems proud.	And so ... she smiles at him ...

SUSAN
... Then we did it right.
(	Very quiet now.	Until Marston clears his throat.
MARSTON
Raymond' s condition is ... seductive.	To all of us.	We all want to ... be the one.	That's part of your charm, Raymond.
Raymond nods.	It is.

MARSTON
You liked being outside the home for awhile, huh?	It was fun.
Raymond nods.	It was.	Marston turns to Charlie ...
MARSTON
You know, Dr. Lenz has a halfway house program.	Starts off ... one weekend a month ... and builds.
Good foster families in the Chicago area ...

CHARLIE
Mercenaries. They smile in your face. They take the money. You think they care about Ray?




(CONTINUED)
128
Dead at Marston 's eyes ...
CHARLIE
Look.	We don't want the doctor's money ... or his foster 'families'
... or his fatherly advice. (beat )
Open your eyes.	Ray and I... we're doing fine.

But Lenz leans forward now.	To Raymond.	Steady gaze. A smile that could only be called fatherly ...

LENZ
Tell me again, Raymond.	How did you hurt your hand?	Really.
Raymond looks from Lenz to Charlie and back.	Then, he does it once more.

RAYMOND
'Course, Daddy's car door was ... it was ...

Course' means he's Almost as if ...
CHARLIE
He's lying.	For me.
The air comes out of Charlie.	He seems smaller somehow. Scared to death.	But ...

CHARLIE
I took him to see... a retarded woman.	His pen- pal.	She hugged him ... she wouldn't let go ... and
... and ...
Staring at his brother.	So hard to say ...
CHARLIE
He went crazy.	Almost ... bit his own hand off.

To Marston now, pleading ...
CHARLIE
My mistake.

Mine.	I learned.
But Lenz stands.	Shakes his head sadly.

You want to,
LENZ
Charlie.

But the

water ... the water' s too deep.
He turns to Raymond.	Stands over him.
LENZ
Raymond.	What do you want?
He gets the reaction.	Right off.	Confusion .	Disorien­ tation .	Lenz 's voice is firm.	Demanding ...

LENZ
Tell me, Raymond.	What do you want?
Raymond's head turns away.	His breath coming harder. Hands wringing, twisting at each other.	Lenz moves now, blocking Charlie' s view as ...

LENZ
Look at me!	What do you want!?

Raymond rapidly disintegrating.	Charlie lurching to see him ...

CHARLIE
Stop it!
Heads turn to Charlie.	He looks to Marston ...
CHARLIE
It makes him crazy.	And he knows it ...
Raymond' s lips move rapidly.	Whispering secret thoughts.
MARSTON
What is it?	What' s doing this?
CHARLIE
Asking what he wants.	He doesn't like it.

LENZ
You have to tell me, have to tell me NOW! WANT?

Raymond.	You  What do you

And slowly , Raymond slides from his seat.	On his knees now.	Eyes locked ahead.	Hands clutched together.	He's beginning to rock back and forth, as he whispers inaudibly ...

Rocking harder now.	Rhythmically.	It's scary as hell ...
SUSAN
Charlie!	Make him stop!

But Marston raises a hand. Wants to see. Raymond begins to shiver. Teeth chatter. trembling.  Just like at the bathtub ...

LENZ
And now ... Body
It's not that he doesn't like it. It frightens him.	Immobilizes him.	Because he doesn't know.
Hear the whispering now.	Just barely ...
RAYMOND
C-h-a-r ... 1-i-e ... C-h- a-r ...
1-i- e ... C-h-a-r ... 1-i-e ...
And with feeling we've never heard from Charlie before, he says simply ...


He knows.
Charlie brushes past Starts to reach both Thinks better of it.
CHARLIE

Lenz now.	Sinks to the floor. hands behind his brother' s head.
The hands come away.
CHARLIE
Ray.	Look at me.	Please.
And Raymond does.	Somehow, the eyes focus.	Charlie' s voice comes so softly ...

CHARLIE
Tell me, Ray.	'Cos I really want to know ...
(beat)
What do you want ...?
Raymond' s eyes.	Moving across Charlie's face.

RAYMOND

I want ... you. Quiet now.	Very quiet.
CHARLIE



CHARLIE
You would have been ... my big brother.	And my best friend.
(beat )
And you would have ... taken care of me, and ... been there when ...
Yes, he would.
(	CHARLIE
So.	I need my brother.

It sounds so sad somehow.	Charlie tries to lighten it with a smile.	But that comes out sad , too.

RAYMOND
C-h-a-r ... 1-i-eee ...

Musical and funny.	Trying to cheer him up.	But that's not easy now.

CHARLIE
Look.	Maybe ... they'll make you go away.	From me.

Oh.	Raymond thinks about that.	He reaches into his pocket now.	Digging out the little wallet.	He pulls from it the water-stained photo.		Raymond at eighteen. Charlie at two.	Sets it aside to reveal ...

... the other photo.	From the MGM Grand.	Two brothers and a lion.	Charlie' s arm around his brother' s shoulder. Raymond' s eyes bugging out.

Raymond reaches out now.	Hands it to Charlie.	As Charlie stares at the photo, Raymond gently closes Charlie' s hand around it.		It's yours now.	Charlie staring ... staring ...

LENZ
Raymond.	You say goodbye.	But just a minute now ...

And Lenz says goodby e to Susan . Kisses her cheek.	He boards.		She stands alone down the platform, looking away.	Not wanting to invade the privacy of the brothers' goodbye.

Charlie looks at Raymond now.	They are alone in the world.	Charlie taps his brother' s backpack ...

CHARLIE
So.	You got the sandwiches.

RAYMOND
Susan made them.

Looks at the open, staring eyes ...
CHARLIE
It's two weeks.	You'll be fine.
